    TERMS & CONDITIONS

    <br />
    By downloading, browsing, accessing, or using this Onepick Application
    (“Onepick Mobile Application”), you agree to be bound by these Terms and
    Conditions of Use. We reserve the right to amend these terms and conditions
    at any time. If you disagree with any of these Terms and Conditions of Use,
    you must immediately discontinue your access to the Onepick Mobile
    Application and your use of the services offered on the Onepick Mobile
    Application. Continued use of the Onepick Mobile Application will constitute
    acceptance of these Terms and Conditions of Use, as may be amended from time
    to time.
    <br />
    TERMS TO USE
    <br />
    ● We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
    possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app
    or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
    charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you
    exactly what you’re paying for. ● The Onepick app stores and processes
    personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service.
    It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
    therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is
    the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
    official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
    vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
    security features and it could mean that the Onepick app won’t work properly
    or at all. ● We cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the
    app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs
    out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, we cannot
    accept responsibility. ● At some point, we may wish to update the app. The
    app is available for Android and iOS– the requirements for the system (and
    for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
    to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
    using the app. It is your responsibility to keep the app version up to date.
    We do not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
    to you and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device.
    However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
    offered to you, we may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
    terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
    ● We strongly recommend that you only download the Onepick applications from
    the Play Store or App Store. Doing so will ensure that your apps are
    legitimate and safe from malicious software.

    <br />

    <br />
    SHARING YOUR CONTENT AND INFORMATION
    <br />

    You own all of the content and information you post on the Onepick App, and
    you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application
    settings. In addition: ● For content that is covered by intellectual
    property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give
    us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application
    settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,
    royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in
    connection with Onepick App (IP License). This IP License ends when you
    delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared
    with others, and they have not deleted it. ● When you delete IP content, it
    is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.
    However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies
    for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others). ●
    When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to
    access your content and information as well as content and information that
    others have shared with you. We require applications to respect your
    privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the
    application can use, store, and transfer that content and information. ●
    When you publish content or information, it means that you are allowing
    everyone, including people of Onepick App, to access and use that
    information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile
    picture). ● We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about
    Onepick App, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions
    without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no
    obligation to offer them).
    <br />

    does not closely relate to a user's actual name).
